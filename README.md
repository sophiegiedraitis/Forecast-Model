This table compares a 3-month moving average and a weighted moving average to forecast short-term demand. Each method was analyzed using mean absolute deviation and it was found that the weighted moving average produced lower forecast error, making it more suitable for environments with recent demand shifts, such as healthcare inventory planning.

**Business Application:** This model supports inventory planning decisions by improving short-term demand forecasts, reducing stockouts and excess inventory in healthcare environments.
